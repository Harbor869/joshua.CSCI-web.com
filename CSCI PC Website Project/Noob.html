                The AMD Ryzen 5600 is a 6-core 12-thread budget gaming cpu that
                will out perform most every other cpu at this price range in
                gaming. Not to mention this cpu comes with a cooler that will

                drive slots, upgraded audio, and enough USB slots for the
                necessities.

                The Team T-Force Vulcan 2x8GB kit is all the memory you will
                need to play any game. At it's price point and 3600mt/s speed,
                this kit is hard to beat and is solid for many builds.

                The Teamgroup MP34 1Tb SSD is a solid (pun-intended) M.2 drive
                that has enough storage for a good handful of games. If you are
                looking to play newer titles that generally require more
                storage, perhaps a 2Tb SSD or an extra SSD should be looked
                into.

                At this price range, the Predator Bifrost Intet Arc A750 is a
                tough graphics card to out perform. 144fps gaming at 1080p can
                be acheived on most games with some requiring to lower settings.
                However, even the top gamers do not play on max settings, so
                neither should you if you are looking to play games at a
                high-level.

                The Phanteks Eclispe G300 case is a solid and budget friendly
                case that comes with a 1-fan and 3-fan option. The mid-tower
                size ensures all components will fit easily and provide for an
                easier building experience (if you are planning to build it
                manually). Both options still may require the purchase of
                additional fans. The case choice is the most flexible of all the
                items listed and is really up to you what you want. For those
                who do not know, this case will provide you will all that you
                need and may want.

                The Rosewill Hive Series 750W power supply has all the power and
                more to run this pc. The 750 watts ensure that you will not need
                another psu if you want to upgrade certain parts of this setup.
                While the bronze certification means this psu is not as effcient
                as higher rated one, the actual difference is so miniscule that
                it is not notciable to the average user.
